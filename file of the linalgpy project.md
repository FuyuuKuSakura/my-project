## function

### GetFunctionGroup

To get the input of function group, then transform functions into dicts

### FindCoefficient

To pick up every coefficient and place them in an authentic matrix
must accept the form that are not entered strictly
for instance, no coefficient(x+2y=5) or negative coeffcient(-2x-7y=-5)

### AuthenticResolving

To seperate the authentix matrix into two part -- the coefficient matrix and the constant matrix

### IsSolvable

To find out how many solutions are there for the equation

### Elimination

To illustrate Gaussian elimination by steps and ultimately lead to the identity and solutions, for those who have one solutions

### IsRowEchelonForm

To confirm if the matrix is a row echelon form

### RowEchelonForm

To transform matrices into row echelon form

### IsReducedRowEchelonForm

To confirm if the matrix is a row echelon form

### ReducedRowEchelonForm

To transform matrices into redueced row echelon form
